# CogniTraffic_ProSync

## Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) is an innovative solution designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion at intersections using edge computing. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project.

## Project Components

### 1. Edge Device Management Module

#### Model:
- DeviceModel: Represents edge device structure and behavior.

#### View:
- DashboardView: Displays connected edge devices and real-time updates.
- DeviceConfigView: Allows administrators to configure edge devices.
- DataAnalyticsView: Displays real-time data processing metrics.

#### Controller:
- DeviceController: Handles user inputs and updates DeviceModel.

### 2. Traffic Optimization Control Module

#### Model:
- TrafficModel: Represents traffic conditions and performance metrics.

#### View:
- TrafficOverviewView: Displays real-time map showing intersections and traffic conditions.
- TrafficLightOptimizationView: Allows manual and dynamic adjustments of traffic light timings.
- PerformanceMetricsView: Displays key performance metrics.

#### Controller:
- TrafficController: Handles user inputs and updates TrafficModel.

### 3. User Interface for Monitoring Module

#### Model:
- SystemModel: Represents the overall system and manages critical events.

#### View:
- MainDashboardView: Displays overview of the entire system and real-time alerts.
- TrafficVisualizationView: Presents interactive map with real-time traffic flow.
- AnalyticsSectionView: Provides historical data analysis tools.
- EmergencyControlView: Allows manual intervention through emergency protocols.

#### Controller:
- SystemController: Handles user inputs and updates SystemModel.

## Technical Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** Utilize HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (React or Angular).
- **Security Measures:** Implement HTTPS and use JWT for user authentication.
- **Real-time Communication:** Use WebSockets for instant updates.
- **Backend Technologies:** Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage.
- **Data Encryption:** Implement secure data encryption mechanisms.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Ensure an intuitive and user-friendly design.
